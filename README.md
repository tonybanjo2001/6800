# Milestone I Project

## Overview

This project, titled **Milestone I**, is an end-to-end analytical workflow developed on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). The notebook is designed to facilitate interactive data exploration, analysis, and model development within a cloud-based environment. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of data ingestion, cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.

## Features

- **Interactive Environment:** Leverages the power of Google Colab for executing and visualizing code.
- **Data Processing:** Includes robust data cleaning and transformation pipelines.
- **Visualization:** Contains dynamic visualizations to support exploratory data analysis.
- **Modeling:** Implements predictive or analytical models with step-by-step explanations.
- **Reproducibility:** Ensures that the analysis can be reproduced in a standard, cloud-based setting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Google Account:** Required to access and use Google Colab.
- **Python Knowledge:** Basic understanding of Python and data science libraries.
- **Internet Connection:** Necessary to run the notebook in the cloud environment.

### Running the Notebook

1. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Upload the `Milestone_I.ipynb` file or open it directly from your repository.
2. **Execute the Cells:**
   - Run the cells sequentially to execute the full workflow.
   - Ensure your runtime is active (select CPU or GPU as needed).

## Repository Structure

- `Milestone_I.ipynb`  
  The primary notebook containing the projectâ€™s complete workflow.
- `README.md`  
  This documentation file outlining the project details, instructions, and guidelines.
- Additional supporting files (if applicable):  
  Data sets, configuration files, or supplementary scripts.

## Dependencies

The notebook uses several Python libraries, including but not limited to:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

*Note:* Google Colab comes with many of these libraries pre-installed. If additional libraries are needed, install them using `!pip install <library_name>` directly in a Colab cell.

## Project Workflow

The notebook is structured to guide users through the following phases:

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  
   Steps to load and clean the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
   Visual and statistical analysis to uncover insights.
3. **Model Building & Evaluation:**  
   Implementation of models, evaluation metrics, and interpretation of results.
4. **Conclusion & Future Work:**  
   Summary of findings and potential avenues for further exploration.
